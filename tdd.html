## What is Agile
- Agile is *not* about having standups
- Agile is *not* about having sprints
- Agile is *not* even about getting *stuff* done
- Agile is basically two key principles: **Inspect** and **Adapt**


##How TDD fits into Agile
* We have the concept of critical distance
* When you show your work to another developer, that person will view things differently from you.
* When you show your work to a tester or QA, he/she will view things differently from you.
* When you show your work to the BA or the Product Manager, that person will view things differently from you.
* When you release your work to the customer, they will view things differently from you.

###TDD is a form of self-introspection or self-reflection. You are criticizing your own code


##TDD is not a silver bullet
* The end goal is better testibility, better readibility, and better specification of the behaviour of the code we write.
* Does not mean we immediately ignore other principles such as SOLID, DRY, or common sense.
* There are some things where TDD does not make sense
> Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is uniquely your own. - Bruce Lee


##TDD is *Hard*
* It takes 10,000 hours for anybody to master anything
* TDD is a part of mastering the craft of developing
* Developing is more than just programming and more than just coding


##Code Coverage
* Not everything
* It's not about covering everything, it's about *attempting* to cover everything.
* Code coverage is the metric that can be covered, code readibility and code testibility cannot be measured.


##'With TDD, we are working *literally* backwards'
* In software, the design is actually really closely tied with the implementation
* With tests, we design the software by a specification before attempting the implementation
* Unit tests are production code. They may not be fun to write, but they are essential to good software


##'We don't have enough time to do TDD'
* Chicken and the Egg problem
* We don't have time because we are fixing bugs for code which either is legacy code, undocumented, or is really hard to read.


##'Why not just write the unit test code afterwards'
* With TDD we are testing code we should be writing
* With CDT we are testing code we have already written
* Our biases *shape* us
* We don't account for some test cases that we may not have thought about.

##Example Code
```groovy
def operateOn(int a, int b) {
	if(a > b) {
		return a - b;
	} else {
		return b - a;
	}
}
```

##Example Test case
```groovy
def whenAIsGreaterThanB() {
	def a = 5;
	def b = 3;
	assert operateOn(a, b) == 2;
}
def whenBIsGreaterThanA() {
	def a = 3;
	def b = 7;
	assert operateOn(a, b) == 4;
}
```

* What if there is a case for ```a == b``` that we haven't accounted for?
* Should we throw an exception?
* What about when either a or b is 0, or negative?
* The code is already written and we are taking the code as the assumed correct behaviour

```groovy
def whenAisEqualToB() {
	def a = 2
	def b = 2
	assert operateOn(a, b) == 0
}
```
What is the correct behaviour? We're assuming that it should return 0


##Red, Green, Refactor
* First write a failing test
* Then write the minimum amount of code to pass that test
* Then refactor the code
